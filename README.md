# Google Copy Cat
In this project, I built a very light copy cat of the google search page using only HTML and CSS. It's not functional, of course, but it gives a look of it.

## What I Learned/Experienced:
- Properly nesting elements and tags
- Setting up navigation bars at top and bottom
- Better understanding of how to center an element
- Better understanding of how positioning and setting the sizes affects the pages.
